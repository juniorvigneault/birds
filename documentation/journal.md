I want to start my first case using a framework I already know (sort of) well, the physics engine matter.js. I've used it a lot in the past, So I think I want to start by listing and brainstorming freely about things I know about it and would want to push further, as well as what could be interesting in combination with other frameworks for visualizing the actual physics.

So I made a list of things I think are interesting to play with using matter.js that I would like to explore based on the [demo](https://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#cloth) page.

### Technical details 
1. Cloth simulation - I've always had the idea of hiding something under it
2. Complex SVG concave shapes (complex physical typography or drawings)
3. Compound bodies of complex shapes - recreating a human doll for example
4. Spring constraints - simple but never tried
5. Soft body - squishy things
6. Complex terrain

I woke up a bit confused this morning about a bunch of stuff. 
1. What I want to make, is it weird web design, games, interactive art, experience... Should I even chose... I think its a web interactive experience game-like thing that incorporate weird web design things that could be used in weird web design?
2. How I should proceed in choosing a theory for each framework
3. Should I start by making small things or brainstorming big things
4. Should I experiment a bit with every theory so see what fits best with each framework? 

I started reading about humour and comedy this morning. I was looking for a sort of overview of the history and different theories that were out there. I decided to read the [philosophy of humor](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/humor/) article from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy to introduce myself to everything. Here are some notes I took :

- Humour is an important part of the human experience but is neglected by philosophers
- Before the 20th century, laughter in philosophy was often negatively associated, condemned, intepreted as a loss of self-control, sometimes even ungodly, malicious, morally objectionable... 
- Plato never laughed (haha)
- This negative approach to laughter and humour led to the **Superiority Theory**, where laughter expresses a feeling of superiority when comparing ourselves to someone else, or a former version of ourself
- **Thomas Hobbes**, english philosopher: "Laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from some sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves, by comparison with the infirmity of others, or with our own formerly." [About Hobes](https://jonathansandling.com/thomas-hobbes-on-humour-and-laughter/)
- Superiority Theory was criticized and weakened during the 18th century because of the avent of the **Relief Theory** & the **Incongruity Theory**
- Relief Theory: first accounts were related to a scientific explanation where the nervous system released imprisoned "animal spirits" in reaction to humour (Earl of Shaftesbury)[https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/shaftesbury1709a_1.pdf]
- Arendt also was into relief theory, relief from pain, where she allegedly forced herself to laugh "uncontrollably" (??) when writing *Eichmann in Jerusalem* (link)[https://www.abc.net.au/religion/the-laughter-of-hannah-arendt/13401584]
- Taking someone on a dark journey and then flipping it to discharge the energy in the end (Herbert Spencer)
- Sigmund Freud also wrote about it, where laughter also releases nervous energy (usually sexual or hostile)
- This theory is also very "debunked" today in regards to humour as process of releasing pent-up energy, questionable theory
- **Incongruity Theory**: also arose in the 18th centyry to challenge the Superiority Theory, is based on the perception of something incongruous - something violating mental patterns or expectations. Is now the dominant theory in philosophy and physchology (James Beattie, Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard...)

SO YEAH.

This is my first entry transcribed from vocal note and edited to make a bit more sense. I'm trying this way of doing instead of traditional writing journaling because talking feels more productive and freeing than writing. Recording allows me to later transcribe and edit, focusing on the essence. Writing gets me too caught up in words and structure.

Currently, I'm experimenting with the "This Person Doesn't Exist" API to generate fictional faces. I then create Matter.js bodies for each pixel of the AI generated face, exploring the intersection of random faces and pixel particles. I don't know why I'm doing this. It's a technical start, aligning with my desire to infuse humor theory into programming I guess. Or just doing something to overcome the blank page syndrome. 

I've delved a bit into humor theories literature, settling on superiority theory for my first case (chronologically, it is sort of the first official theory, so it makes sense to start my creative journey with it as well). The challenge is integrating humor theory seamlessly into my work, not just discussing it. My approach involves small technical explorations with Matter.js, infusing them with superiority theory.

For example, using friction in Matter.js, and finding ways to create humor based on superiority theory using this specific element to create a small sketch. The goal is to have around 10 such explorations per theory, eventually leading to a more significant project with a narrative aspect or a more developped conceptual approach. Each case will have a list of sources from various authors discussing the chosen humor theory. This week, I'll compile resources on superiority theory to deepen my understanding.

SO. This semester, Matter.js is my main framework, with a focus on physics and the integration of superiority theory. Other frameworks may come into play, but the primary emphasis is on the chosen theory and physics in Matter.js.
