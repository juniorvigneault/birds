I want to start my first case using a framework I already know (sort of) well, the physics engine matter.js. I've used it a lot in the past, So I think I want to start by listing and brainstorming freely about things I know about it and would want to push further, as well as what could be interesting in combination with other frameworks for visualizing the actual physics.

So I made a list of things I think are interesting to play with using matter.js that I would like to explore based on the [demo](https://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#cloth) page.

### Technical details 
1. Cloth simulation - I've always had the idea of hiding something under it
2. Complex SVG concave shapes (complex physical typography or drawings)
3. Compound bodies of complex shapes - recreating a human doll for example
4. Spring constraints - simple but never tried
5. Soft body - squishy things
6. Complex terrain

I woke up a bit confused this morning about a bunch of stuff. 
1. What I want to make, is it weird web design, games, interactive art, experience... Should I even chose... I think its a web interactive experience game-like thing that incorporate weird web design things that could be used in weird web design?
2. How I should proceed in choosing a theory for each framework
3. Should I start by making small things or brainstorming big things
4. Should I experiment a bit with every theory so see what fits best with each framework? 

I started reading about humour and comedy this morning. I was looking for a sort of overview of the history and different theories that were out there. I decided to read the [philosophy of humor](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/humor/) article from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy to introduce myself to everything. Here are some notes I took :

- Humour is an important part of the human experience but is neglected by philosophers
- Before the 20th century, laughter in philosophy was often negatively associated, condemned, intepreted as a loss of self-control, sometimes even ungodly, malicious, morally objectionable... 
- Plato never laughed (haha)
- This negative approach to laughter and humour led to the **Superiority Theory**, where laughter expresses a feeling of superiority when comparing ourselves to someone else, or a former version of ourself
- **Thomas Hobbes**, english philosopher: "Laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from some sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves, by comparison with the infirmity of others, or with our own formerly." [About Hobes](https://jonathansandling.com/thomas-hobbes-on-humour-and-laughter/)
- Superiority Theory was criticized and weakened during the 18th century because of the avent of the **Relief Theory** & the **Incongruity Theory**
- Relief Theory: first accounts were related to a scientific explanation where the nervous system released imprisoned "animal spirits" in reaction to humour (Earl of Shaftesbury)[https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/shaftesbury1709a_1.pdf]
- Arendt also was into relief theory, relief from pain, where she allegedly forced herself to laugh "uncontrollably" (??) when writing *Eichmann in Jerusalem* (link)[https://www.abc.net.au/religion/the-laughter-of-hannah-arendt/13401584]
- Taking someone on a dark journey and then flipping it to discharge the energy in the end (Herbert Spencer)
- Sigmund Freud also wrote about it, where laughter also releases nervous energy (usually sexual or hostile)
- This theory is also very "debunked" today in regards to humour as process of releasing pent-up energy, questionable theory
- **Incongruity Theory**: also arose in the 18th centyry to challenge the Superiority Theory, is based on the perception of something incongruous - something violating mental patterns or expectations. Is now the dominant theory in philosophy and physchology (James Beattie, Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, Søren Kierkegaard...)

SO YEAH.

This is my first entry transcribed from vocal note and edited to make a bit more sense. I'm trying this way of doing instead of traditional writing journaling because talking feels more productive and freeing than writing. Recording allows me to later transcribe and edit, focusing on the essence. Writing gets me too caught up in words and structure.

Currently, I'm experimenting with the "This Person Doesn't Exist" API to generate fictional faces. I then create Matter.js bodies for each pixel of the AI generated face, exploring the intersection of random faces and pixel particles. I don't know why I'm doing this. It's a technical start, aligning with my desire to infuse humor theory into programming I guess. Or just doing something to overcome the blank page syndrome. 

I've delved a bit into humor theories literature, settling on superiority theory for my first case (chronologically, it is sort of the first official theory, so it makes sense to start my creative journey with it as well). The challenge is integrating humor theory seamlessly into my work, not just discussing it. My approach involves small technical explorations with Matter.js, infusing them with superiority theory.

For example, using friction in Matter.js, and finding ways to create humor based on superiority theory using this specific element to create a small sketch. The goal is to have around 10 such explorations per theory, eventually leading to a more significant project with a narrative aspect or a more developped conceptual approach. Each case will have a list of sources from various authors discussing the chosen humor theory. This week, I'll compile resources on superiority theory to deepen my understanding.

SO. This semester, Matter.js is my main framework, with a focus on physics and the integration of superiority theory. Other frameworks may come into play, but the primary emphasis is on the chosen theory and physics in Matter.js.

Hello,
I'm feeling so good because my porftolio using matter.js got featured on a nice website that feature weird websites. This got me excited and then I posted my pixelated faces experiment on instagram because I was excited, and then when I was writing my little caption I wrote : 

"Currently obsessed with printing pixelated people that don’t exist using the @peoplethatdontexist API

I don’t know why this is so satisfying and weird to me. Feels like I’m digitally birthing these people."

This made me realize two things:
1. I only get ideas when I'm happy
2. I think I care too much what people think about me

But anyway, the idea behind printing people that don't exist was inspired by Darius Kazemi's [Make Someone](https://tinysubversions.com/stuff/person/) where you generate a new AI person by clicking on a button, and then this person is associated with three random characteristics (that can contradict each other, making it even funnier imo). This makes me think about the superiority theory in a way where I feel the humor is coming from feeling superior to the person I'm creating. I feel like they are ridiculous, especially with these random values and beliefs. There is something funny in the fact that they are not consenting to being created even, and given a personality at random. We laugh at them, activating the superiority theory (I FEEL LIKE). I'm still looking for good literature about the theories, but I'm noticing that OF COURSE they are sort of mixed together. Like there is definitely incongruity theory in here.

I was trying to think about examples of things I find funny related to superiority theory, and I thought about something I did that was kind of mean in CEGEP. So there was this girl from my high school that claimed to be a photographer but her pictures were horrendous really. She had a Facebook page with all her photographs, and one day she posted an album with really awful photos of a bunch of girls (also from my high school) going for a night out. The pictures were taken in a weird basement with bad lighting, and the girls all had their cute outfits with tiaras, yes, *tiaras*. There was a bunch of different absurdly normal photographic dispositions with different girls sitting, standing, and crouching in different areas of the basement, and the last shots were in front of a limousine parked on the street, which they had rented for going out on a Saturday (???).

Needless to say, my mean friends and I thought this was completely hilarious and these pictures became a sort of golden grail of artistic ideas. At the time as students, when applying for a student credit card, we could choos a photo that would be a background for our credit cards, and I very excitedly decided to take one of them as my credit card picture. Then my friend made a crew-neck featuring 2 other pictures that I got for my birthday, and I think we even did a mouse pad at one point. We were thinking of making a whole collection of items featuring these pictures basically. Even though they knew nothing about that (I think?), this was obviously mean, and now I kind of feel bad about it, but I still think it is hilarious and inspiring. We became genuinely obsessed with these pictures, so much that we started to love them for their aesthetic and really, they became art in our eyes, which is maybe even more mean, but I don't know, the line became blurry at some point.

All that to say that I think I want to take inspiration from this to work on my first case. And working with the pixelated faces, and writing about giving **digital birth** to them (project title idea????????), I thought I could maybe create something where you have to give birth to an AI-generated person that grows and gets older, an experience where you are the parent of this person. I think parents probably laugh at their children and feel superior??? Maybe. I also thought about being a teacher and teaching a classroom with AI faces and laughing at them. Exploiting a sort of power dynamics for LAUGHS. Like a kindergarten class could be funny. Or mayby not trying to recreate something like an environment, just a page where an person that doesn't exist needs to be taken care of. I think since they are AI people, then feelings don't really get involved, and that leaves a lot of space for comedy. GOOD TALK.
